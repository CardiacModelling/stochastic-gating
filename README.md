# Parameter inference for stochastic reaction models of ion channel gating from whole-cell voltage-clamp data
Code to replicate the analyses from the article "Parameter inference for stochastic reaction models of ion channel gating from whole-cell voltage-clamp data".

Figures 3-9 of the paper can be reproduced by running the corresponding .sh files fig3.sh, fig4.sh, etc. The figures will be stored in the folder "./results/allFigures/", which will be dynamically generated after running the code.
